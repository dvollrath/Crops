Following this document are the editor's report from Imran Rasul at JEEA, along with the four referee reports. We have not prepared point-by-point responses to each of the four referees, as the paper was rejected at JEEA. This document explains our revisions to the paper based on the major issues highlighted by Imran, which relate to specific criticisms that can be found in the referee reports. 

By far the greatest concern was with the empirical methodology. We do not have a natural experiment or clever instrument to leverage here. Our results are based on cross-sectional comparisons of districts within provinces of countries. As we explain in the first section here, this is plausible strategy under a mild set of assumptions.

### Methodology
Simply put, we are trying to estimate a parameter of a production function: the elasticity of agricultural output with respect to land. This has the standard issues of attempting to identify the parameter from observable data, knowing there are unobervable things that enter into the decisions of producers. We are well aware of the large literature doing such estimation a la Olley/Pakes or Levinsohn/Petrin techniques, which uses panel data and assumptions about input use to control for unobserved productivity. In our situation we do not have panel data, or reliable data on all the inputs used in production, so those techniques are not applicable. But we do have plausible measures of agricultural TFP from the FAO's GAEZ project, and given data at the district level within countries we can use fixed effects to eliminate country and state/province level unobservables.

The referees read our methodology as requiring several strict assumptions to eliminate these issues: perfect factor mobility across districts within a province, an absence of distortions to agricultural prices, and the homogeneity of non-agricultural and agricultural goods. Of course, it does not make sense to assert that those assumptions hold across all provinces in all countries of the world. Quite sensibly, referees either wanted some supporting evidence for these assumptions, or simply rejected that they could be true. 

However, none of those assumptions are necessary for our methodology. But we did not make a clear explanation of this in the prior version of the paper (although we might grumble a little about referees overlooking some text where we did address these issues). In trying to lay out the intuition behind our method, we did use several simplifying assumptions that we later relaxed, but that did not translate well for the reader. 

The substantial revision to the paper that occurred was to make the assumptions (or lack thereof) behind our methods more transparent in Section 2. The paper has the full explanation, but here we lay out the logic of the methodology and how it avoids making the unpalatable assumptions cited by the prior referees.

There are several districts within a province. Farmers within each district are price-takers for their output and factor inputs, and minimize costs. The prices of output and inputs facing farmers are each combination of a province-level average price and a district-specific "wedge". Using the first-order conditions of the cost-minimization problem we show that there is a simple log-linear relationship between agricultural productivity, rural density, the province-level average prices, and the district-specific wedges. 

This relationship is our regression specification. The coefficient relating agricultural productivity and rural density is the land elasticity we want to estimate. Empirically, our problem is handling the presence of the province-level average prices and district-specific wedges, both of which are unobserved, in that regression.

The province-level average prices of output and inputs are handled with province fixed effects. This eliminates them without putting any assumptions on how they are set. Thus these province average prices may be arbitrarily distorted from a competitive equilibrium in any direction via any source: taxes, subsidies, the influence of the non-agricultural sector, international trade, barriers to movement, and so on. It is irrelevant what determines the province level average prices because we only use comparisons of districts *within* provinces to make our estimates. Country, or even province, level differences in agricultural policy, urbanization, market access, institutions, etc.. are all absorbed by our province fixed effects.

District-level wedges to prices are the central issue for us empirically. As we do not have district-level measures of wedges, we use a series of control variables to proxy for them. The main controls include night lights, the urban percent of population, and total population of the district. We believe these will capture district-level differences in output or input prices within provinces that the wedges represent. As a robustness check, we also allow for third-degree polynomials of all of these to capture any non-linear relationships of them with district-level wedges.

For this version of the paper we also linked a subset of our districts to DHS survey data, and have controls for the characteristcs of the rural population in those districts: age, education level, household assets, and agricultural assets. Including those gives us results that are nearly identical to our baseline results (Table 5).

The credibility of our results hinges on whether one believes we have controlled for these district-level wedges or not. We believe the consistency of our results across specifications and robustness checks puts the weight of evidence in our favor. Others might disagree. But this version of the paper should make more clear that our results are not just valid under narrow assumptions about perfect factor markets or absences of distortions in agriculture. 

### Measurement issues
Taking the methodology as given, the second main area of concern raised regarded the data. We use a measure of agricultural productivity - the caloric suitability index (CSI) of Ozak and Galor - that is based on the FAO's GAEZ project. The CSI is built using GAEZ estimates of crop productivity based on the assumption of "low" input use, or basic subsistence farming. Referees raised the concern that this may not be the relevant level of input use to consider across the world. For this version of the paper, we included robustness checks where we re-derived the CSI using Ozak and Galor's methods but with underlying GAEZ data on "medium" or "high" input use, as well as for irrigated agriculture. That is in Table 4 of the paper. In all cases, the pattern of results is consistent with our baseline.

This version of the paper is also more explicit that our results are not sensitive to the specific crops that are used to calculate the CSI, and in fact our results do not depend on using Ozak and Galor's CSI index at all, as we show. Referees were also concerned that our findings were peculiar to our choice of how to denote districts as "temperate" or "tropical", but as we explain in Section 3.2 we can use several alternative ways of assigned districts and receive similar results (and see Table 2, Panel A).

There were also complaints about the use of the HYDE data for rural population by district. This complaint seemed unfounded to us, in the sense that Table 3 includes robustness checks where we used population data from the GRUMP project, as well as from IPUMS. The IPUMS data also allowed us to confirm that rural population was in fact a good proxy for agricultural population. Our results have never been sensitive to the use of HYDE as the baseline population data. 

### Epidemiological transition
Both in this JEEA submission and a prior one, referees were somewhat split on the analysis in Section 4.2 that uses the epidemiological transition to test whether in fact areas with a high land elasticity (temperate) are more sensitive to population shocks, a prediction of the simple model we use to illustrate the effect of the land elasticity. It uses the data and set-up from Acemoglu and Johnson's 2007 paper on the effects of life expectancy on living standards. 

There are open questions about the Acemoglu and Johnson paper, of course, and so some referees question the inclusion of this in our paper. For our purposes, it is the distinction in the results between temperate and tropical areas that is of interest. Whether those results are strictly causal is less important. But the inclusion of this section in the final paper, if we were fortunate enough to have it accepted, is not central to our findings.
