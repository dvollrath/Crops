1.	I have a general concern that what this paper is doing amounts to production function estimation without panel data, and without instruments there is a gigantic literature (e.g. Levinsohn and Petrin, 2003, RESTUD) on how it is hard to estimate TFP. And yet this paper tells us that by assuming Cobb-Douglas, profit maximization, and free movement of factors within provinces, we can solve for equation (5) and estimate it directly. It appears that there is a large gap between what the users of micro-data do and what macroeconomists do when confronted with the same problem. What the authors do is in the spirit of, say Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2007) or Allen (1979). But can we lean so heavily on functional forms and theory to give us simple estimating equations that claim to tell us many things about the world?

If the exercise here really does hinge on some modeling assumptions, I would like to see evidence in their favor. 

i.	If the Cobb Douglas form is so central to the paper, can the authors provide concrete evidence in its favor? In particular, the assumption that capital is labor-augmenting rather than land augmenting seems artificial. Is it important? 
ii.	If the model claims that wages and the return to capital are constant within a province, I would like to see evidence of that from micro-data, at least for some selected countries for which these data are easily available. 
iii.	Similarly, there are datasets in which you can measure the assumption on page 8 that the share of non-agricultural output paid to labor is equal to the share in agriculture.
iv.	The assumption in slide 13 that the components of TFP are log-linear with coefficients of one: is this without loss of generality? Is it testable in micro data where TFP estimation can be done more “correctly” or “completely”? Relatedly, how crucial is the assumption of a coefficient of 1 in equation 14?
v.	The paper assumes that land quality is the only component of TFP that varies within a province. It isn’t immediately clear what this means in “the real world”. That one district can’t have better government than its neighbor? That it can’t have older tractors? This too is an assumption that can be tested in micro-data for a handful of countries for which such data exist.

Similarly, the data are a cross-section, not a panel. In a generic sense, this reduces the credibility of the estimation (a paper that can do “within” estimation is generally more credible than one that relies only on “between” estimation). In the specific context of this paper, the outcome variable can only be measured at one point in time, but the main independent variable (effectively log population density) could be measured at any point in history. Are the results different if the HYDE data from 1900 or 1500 are used? If so, do we worry? If not, do we doubt the HYDE data?

There is not much concern about identification here. Fixed effects remove province-level unobservables that correlate with both land quality and population density, but there is little done (e.g. coefficient stability) to show that district-level unobservables are unlikely to explain the results. A simple example: being bisected by a river may improve land quality via water availability while also increasing population because of reduced transportation costs. Of course, this is but one example – there must be hundreds of variables that vary within province and correlate with both the outcome and main independent variables. 

2.	There is a gap between the title and what the paper does. The paper estimates the exponent on land in the production function. The Malthusian model is, at its heart, about three relationships: how fertility responds to income, how mortality responds to income, and how average product relates to income. The equilibrium income in this model is set by the intersection of the births curve and the deaths curve, with no reference to the production function at all. Similarly, look at Ashraf and Galor’s “Dynamics and Stagnation” paper, and in particular at equation (13). The steady state income depends on a parameter of the utility function and the cost of children – again, the shape of the production function plays no role. 

But then, in the current paper, I look at equation 11, and I see that income and its response to shocks both depend on beta. At first this seems like a surprise that contradicts the Malthusian model, but then I realize that this is a static equilibrium for a given L, and not the steady state. But without fertility and mortality responding to income, or a steady state, can a model be described as Malthusian at all?

When I think about a typical empirical Malthusian paper, similarly, I usually think of one that estimates the fertility, mortality, and marriage responses to exogenous shocks (e.g. work by DR Weir or E. A. Wrigley). This paper doesn’t really fit in that literature at all.

We live in a world where incomes and population are both rising. That is in contrast to the predictions of the Malthusian model. Does it make sense to write this paper using data from after the Industrial Revolution?

I think there are two paths here. Either reframe the paper, or derive predictions in the steady state. I think the first would make more sense: it is in the spirit of the paper to take a snapshot of the world in 2000, when it would be hard to argue that any part of it is in its Malthusian steady state. That said, it likely that the main equation (5) also holds in the steady state, and so the paper isn’t “wrong” when estimations are performed out of equilibrium, but rather that Proposition 1 collapses to something simpler?

In short: Are you sure this paper is about Malthus at all? Is it really the case that “curvature of the production function” is what we really think of when we talk about a “constraint”? Constraints are usually expressed as “less than” restrictions, not as exponents. 

Related: on page 12, “whether there is a Malthusian land constraint” and “whether there are diminishing returns to land in production” are treated as equivalent statements. Are they?

3.	The paper has a clever proxy at the global level for agricultural TFP. But the entire paper is estimated using remote-sensed “meso” data without information on actual farmers. It would be possible, for some selected countries, to compare the results obtained by this satellite exercise to results obtained using agricultural censuses, LSMS surveys, and other surveys that contain real output data from real farmers.

4.	If I take a big step back and think about the paper, the exercise here seems strange. The authors assume that ln(Y)=ln A + b ln X + (1-b)a ln K + (1-b)(1-a) ln L. Given this equation, I would try to find data on Y, data on X, and an instrument for X. Here, the authors estimate b by regressing ln(A) on ln(L/X) and some fixed effects. This follows from the model assumptions, but it seems to be a very roundabout way of doing something straightforward. Should I find it bizarre that a paper estimating the effect of land on output doesn’t require data on output?

Minor worries:
•	Why are districts the unit of observation? District boundaries may be drawn in part based on agricultural zones. If the data here are largely from gridded satellite sources, why use administrative boundaries at all rather than artificial cells as in the work of Stelios Michalopoulos. A “district” is a very different unit in different countries, and districts from different countries may have very different populations, areas, shares of total population, shares of total area, etc… If this is entirely driven by the desire not to accidentally re-estimate HYDE’s gridding algorithm, why not instead use e.g. the UNEP or DCW data instead?
•	Why use the HYDE data at all? These are a rather opaque source of mostly back-projected population data that are used for historical periods because of their availability, not because of the transparent construction, reliability, or accuracy. Modern development and growth economists use other sources (especially the GPW) so this is a conspicuously odd choice. When these are used for 1900 and 1950, aren’t the HYDE data mostly created using back projection? Regressing log density in 2000 on log density in 1900 gives a too-high-to-believe R-squared. Allusions are made to censuses as the basis of the HYDE data, but it isn’t clear to me that’s how they are constructed. An appendix describing how these are made would help give credibility, presuming the HYDE data are credible.
•	Timing is not clear in this paper. Do we just presume that everything is measured in 2000? The FAO data are somewhat “timeless”, the HYDE data appear to be for a specific year, and the lights data appear to be for that year as well. But the year 2000 is a single year… is it just selected for convenience? Why not 2010? 2000 is almost 20 years ago now.
•	Why should we care about land per person, rather than farm size? If Africans have very small farms despite lower population density, should we treat them conceptually as being similar to farmers in Asia?
•	Technically, the model predictions refer to agricultural labor, not to population. Is it fair to treat one as an empirical proxy for the other? Is a sufficient assumption that the share of the rural population engaged in agricultural labor is constant within a province?
•	In the empirical conversion from rural to agricultural populations (e.g. on page 13): could the IPUMS census data, which I think reports occupation, be used to validate this?
•	It seems strange to make nighttime lights a control. That appears to be an outcome of both land quality and population, among other variables. Why is it on the right hand side and not the left hand side? The same comment applies to urbanization.
•	Why do the estimations not require data on non-land inputs? Is this for the same reason capital is netted out by the province fixed effect?
•	In equation (5), measurement error in population density, which must exist, will systematically bias downwards estimates of (5). Instrumental variables using an alternative measure would be a standard solution.
•	Footnote 8 (defining the indirect utility function) should be moved to the text, and this specific form should be defended, since it isn’t clear to me whether it can be derived from any standard utility function.
•	Proposition 1c (and generally): should “population” be universally replaced as “the labor force”? These concepts seem to be used interchangeably in the paper and it is not clear if the reader should be misled into believing that the labor force in the model and the population in the data are truly the same.
•	On page 15: would it not make more sense to normalize by land that could be cultivated, rather than all land? Some land is of very low quality and should not be in the denominator.
•	Should national parks and forest reserves be removed from the data?
•	Estimating results separately by region is one way to give us an idea of the variation across the world in beta estimates. Is there any way to plot these on a map? I don’t think there’s one “right” way to do this, but I have two suggestions. First, estimate a random coefficients model and plot the coefficient estimated for each district. Second, for each district, estimate results keeping districts only within a certain distance of it, and plot that number as the estimate on the map. Researcher-imposed sample splits cannot be the only valid way to examine heterogeneity in the data, nor can it be the best way to depict it visually.
•	Can the correlation between factor shares and beta estimates be used to validate the method and result? In micro-data, are sharecropping conventions different where beta is greater or smaller?
•	There doesn’t seem to be much consideration of prices or cash crops in this paper. If my output is not consumed locally, would that change the model and invalidate the estimating equations? If my government subsidizes or taxes cash crops, is that an omitted variable that we can simply ignore in the main regressions? In section 3.6, it seems bizarre to drop districts below the 25th percentile in staple crop production. This just drops small districts, whether or not they are dependent on cash crops. This dropping should be based on the importance of cash crops (or their relative productivity) within the district, e.g. 25% of this district’s output is staple crops, or e.g. the most high productivity crop in this district is a stable crop. Also: how are cash crops defined?
•	Section 4.1. should be cut. It is somewhat unrelated to the rest of the paper, builds on a paper that has been heavily criticized, involves arbitrary cuts at the median, seems to forget that the main point of the Acemoglu paper was a zero effect on GDP.
